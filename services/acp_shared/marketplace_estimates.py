    This is a DELIBERATE, CONSERVATIVE COMMERCIAL SIMULATION for the tenant-facing upsell number
    ("12 tour -> 87 atom -> ~7 tháng @3 bài/tuần"), NOT a measurement of a real technical limit.
    It assumes every atom backs exactly one never-repeated post. That assumption does NOT hold in
    services.acp_planning.allocator: `_eligible_atoms()` only excludes an atom for `deleted=true`
    (manual curation) or same-month/same-trip/same-channel reuse (`used_this_month`, a local set
    reset on every `compute_slot_grid()` call, never persisted across months) -- an atom can be
    picked again next month with nothing stopping it. `cooldown_until` is read by the allocator
    but has zero write sites anywhere in this repo (grep-confirmed, AA-330 Phần B STEP 0); the
    `ATOM_COOLDOWN_WEEKS = 6` constant in acp_planning/constants.py is defined but never imported
    anywhere either. So atoms do not actually deplete today.

    DO NOT "fix" this formula to match the real allocator's reuse behavior, no matter the
    reasoning -- Nghiep's explicit instruction (AA-330 Phần B build task) is to keep the
    conservative, table-matching model as the number shown to tenants. `WEEKS_PER_MONTH = 4`
    (not 4.33) is not invented here either -- it is the same tiling `allocator.py`'s own
    `compute_slot_grid()` uses for one month's slot grid.

    Verified against the issue's own example table (AA-330 Phần B STEP 0, 08/08/2026):
    87 atoms @ 3 posts/week -> floor(87/12) = 7 (issue: ~7 tháng); 180 @ 5/week -> floor(180/20)
    = 9 (issue: ~9 tháng); 360 @ 7/week -> floor(360/28) = 12 (issue: "12+ tháng").

    Returns None (not 0) for posts_per_week <= 0 -- a zero/negative cadence has no meaningful
    "months until depletion" under this model."""

# raw_tours.src_itineraries is NULL, which fails v_trip_registry's own pre-existing floor (migration

# here (same bug class, and it would surface the moment that unrelated NULL gets backfilled) and
# still regression-tested, but it was never an actual live-displayed wrong price the way Tomioka
# Silk Mill was.

# $5 sits in the middle of the empirically-confirmed gap ($1.27/$1.33 -> $10.50) and separately
