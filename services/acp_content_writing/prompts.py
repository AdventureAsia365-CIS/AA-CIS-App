services.acp_content_writing.prompts — T9 write-step (SKILL_v2.md workflow step 9) prompt
construction. Referenced (not reused, ADR §0.5) against services/acp_s4_social/writer.py's
ContentBrief-assembly shape — written fresh here against T8's real inputs (angle_gate_request/
angle_gate_option, channel_style.py, goals.py, brand_audience.py), not the old ContentBrief.

No hardcoded per-channel word-count numbers (STEP0 §Open Question #3 / build task's own explicit
instruction — neither SKILL_v2.md's own Channel Rules nor T8's real Bảng-2 source,
channel_style.py, states one) — length guidance is qualitative, from channel_style.py's
`structure`/`style` fields, same as the LLM already gets for angle generation (generate.py).

AA-452: `channel_style.py`'s own `blog` entry describes an N7-shaped structure ("Hook→context→
structured H2 sections→FAQ (if TOFU)→CTA") that this module never actually asked the model to
produce in markup terms until now — investigation confirmed T9's blog channel genuinely can
carry N7's F3 (structural variance)/F5 (atom density)/F7 (FAQ dedup) gates, not just F1/F2/F4/F6/
F8/F9. `_BLOG_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS` below is appended ONLY when `channel_style['channel'] ==
'blog'` — the other 7 channels' prompts are byte-for-byte unchanged. Two requirements, both new
markup the writer wasn't asked for before:
  1. Real markdown `## ` H2 headers per section (+ `## FAQ` with `**Q: ...**`/`A: ...` pairs if
     the piece includes one) — so `quality_gates.gate_structural_variance()`/`gate_faq_dedup()`
     (ported from `acp_produce/gates.py`, same regexes) have real structure to check.
  2. A `[R:{atom_id}]` tag after every sentence built from a seed fact — same tag shape N7 uses,
     but T9 has exactly one atom per piece so there's only ever one id (no closed-world check
     needed, same simplification `gate_grounding()` already made in AA-450). This is INTERNAL
     provenance markup only, for `gate_atom_density()`/`gate_grounding()` to see — it is never
     shown to the tenant: `quality_gates.strip_citation_tags()` removes every tag from
     `content_text` (and from every gate_ledger/repair_log violation string) before
     `service.write_and_check()` ever persists or returns a piece, for every channel, blog
     included. Non-blog channels never receive this instruction, so they never produce a tag to
     strip in the first place — `strip_citation_tags()` runs on their output too (a deliberate,
     no-cost safety net, not dead code — see that function's own docstring).

different angle) — it is never shown to the reader, so it does not need to read well as prose,

Rules:
- Combine the brand/audience context, the channel's structure and style, the selected goal's
  writing method, and the chosen angle every time. Do not write from channel style alone.
- Use concrete, verifiable details from the content seed given. Never invent a fact, number,
  measurement, or claim that is not in the content seed.
- Include the given call to action, worked naturally into the piece — not pasted on as a bare
  final sentence unless the channel's own style calls for that.
- Avoid generic AI-style writing: no vague benefit stacks, no fake urgency, no unsupported
  superlatives, no manipulative language, no rhetorical-question padding, no clichés ("hidden
  gem", "bucket list", "must-visit", "breathtaking", "unforgettable", "nestled", "tapestry",
  "embark on", "immerse yourself", "look no further", "in today's fast-paced world",
  "game-changing", "revolutionary", "unlock your potential").
- Sound human, specific, and lightly persuasive — not corporate, not hype-driven.
