services.acp_produce.rule_adapter — AA-363 wiring apply_output_rules() (S4's
deterministic post-processor, api/services/acp_post_processor.py, AA-49 H-2)
into N7 Produce, WITHOUT modifying that function (architecture decision,
Linear AA-363 comment 05/08/2026: shared acp_output_rules table, no new
table, no migration — 18/22 seed rules are pipeline-agnostic brand-voice/
anti-leak checks, 4/22 are harmless-but-inert S4-vocabulary strings for N7,
0/22 are S4-structural).

STEP 0 (re-verified, not assumed from the earlier survey):

1. Field-name gap, confirmed real: apply_output_rules()'s _TEXT_FIELDS =
   ("content", "content_md", "seo_title", "seo_meta", "title"). Piece
   (services.acp_produce.models) only has `body_tagged` — none of those
   names. Calling apply_output_rules() with a raw dict built from a Piece
   (e.g. {"body_tagged": ...}) makes _collect_text_fields() return [],
   which makes EVERY rule silently no-op — a fail-open, not a crash. Fixed
   here with piece_to_rule_input() mapping body_tagged -> "content" (the
   first name in _TEXT_FIELDS, and the same fallback key
   acp_post_processor.py's own "replace"/"truncate" logic uses when
   "content_md" is absent — not an S4-specific name, the generic default).
   test_aa363_rule_adapter.py::test_no_adapter_fails_open proves the failure
   mode this fixes actually happens without the adapter.

2. Call point, confirmed from the REAL function, not from AA-298.md's
   pipeline-order note: acp_post_processor.py's own module docstring says
   "Call order in S4 flow: LLM generation -> apply_output_rules() -> ...",
   and the function signature (`output: dict` in, mutated output dict out,
   raises OutputRuleViolation on block) only makes sense against completed
   generated text — there is nothing to check before a draft exists.
   AA-298.md's "C1/C2 DFS -> C3 brief compile -> apply_output_rules() ->
   E1-E5 generation -> F1-F9 gates" one-line pipeline summary is WRONG about
   this ordering (apply_output_rules() cannot run before E1-E5, since E1-E5
   is what produces the text it checks) — not corrected in AA-298.md itself
   (historical record of that session), documented here and in
   docs/implementation-notes/AA-363.md instead. Correct point: AFTER E1-E5
   generation produces piece.body_tagged, before/alongside F1-F9
   (deterministic checks are cheap; running them before the F8/F9 Nova Pro
   judge calls avoids paying for a judge call on content that was always
   going to be rejected for a banned word).

3. NOT plugged into gates.py::run_gates()'s own `gate_fns` list — confirmed
   structurally incompatible: run_gates() calls `gate_fn(piece.body_tagged)`
   synchronously (no `await`), while apply_output_rules() is async and
   requires a live `db` connection + `tenant_id`/`stage`. Also
   OutputRuleViolation is control flow raised as an exception, not a
   returned GateResult, and "flag"-type triggers just mutate a dict key —
   neither shape matches `Callable[[str], GateResult]`.
   apply_output_rules_to_piece() below normalizes both outcomes into a
   GateResult so a future orchestrator can append it to piece.gate_ledger
   the same way run_gates() does for F1/F8/F9, as its OWN separate async
   step — not a change to run_gates() or gates.py.

4. No live N7 orchestrator exists yet to call this from (same situation as
   AA-361's write_usage_log() and AA-362's emit_piece_metrics() — this is a
   ready-to-call building block, not a wired pipeline step).

5. GateResult convention in this codebase: `passed = not violations`
   everywhere (F1/F8/F9, gates.py) — there is no separate "warning, but
   still passed" concept. A "flag"-type rule trigger is therefore mapped to
   passed=False here too, even though S4's own flow treats "flag" as
   informational-only (content still ships, flagged for review) rather than
   a hard reject. This is a real behavior difference for N7 (stricter than
   S4), called out explicitly rather than silently inherited — see
   docs/implementation-notes/AA-363.md for the reasoning.

6. `stage` passed as None for N7 today: every one of the 22 seed rules uses
   stage=NULL (global) already (migration 020) — there is no N7-specific
   stage code to opt into yet, and inventing one here (schema allows any
   smallint, no CHECK constraint) without a real second N7-only rule to
   justify it would be premature. If a genuinely N7-only rule is ever
   needed, choosing that stage number is a decision for whoever adds it,
   not invented in this issue.
