services.acp_produce.models — shared types for N7 Produce (AA-298 gate
stack + AA-369 C1/C2/C3 research/brief models).

GateResult/Piece: minimal on purpose, only what gate_grounding() (F1, P0-1)
and run_gates() (P0-3) need — see AA-298.md.

KeywordRecord/SERPProfile/FAQCandidate/Brief (AA-369): field sets ported
from the aamc/ prototype (docs/AI-gent-for automation works/aa-marketing-v2/
aamc/models.py, spec reference only, never imported by real code) and
cross-checked against what E1 (AA-370, not yet built) will need to read off
Brief (required_h2s + atoms_by_section + framework + word_range) — see
AA-369 STEP 0 comment on Linear. `Brief.gap_statement` stays Optional[str]
(None when the Bedrock satellite call fails or is skipped) — it is
supplementary content, never a condition of TOPIC REJECTED (that's the
demand law in compile_brief(), services/acp_produce/research.py).
