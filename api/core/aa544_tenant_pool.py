AA-544 -- aa_app_user tenant pool + per-request RLS GUC helper.

Rollout scope: wired into routes ONE AT A TIME, each behind its OWN Redis flag (see
STAGE_FLAGS below), per AA-544's original plan's Stage 5 principle ("mo rong dan tung route,
moi route revert rieng qua flag"). Do NOT import this into another router without going
through AA-544's own stage-by-stage report-then-confirm ritual first -- picking which route is
next is a decision, not something to copy-paste in ad hoc. Live routes so far:
  - Stage 1 (10/09/2026): GET /v1/publish-log/pending (v1_publish.py::list_pending)
  - Stage 5 (10/09/2026): GET /v1/content-writing/pieces/{piece_id} (service.py::fetch_piece)

Design (matches AA-544's approved 2-pool split): Admin (/admin/*) keeps app.state.pool
(aa_cis_admin, BYPASSRLS) unchanged, always. This module adds a SECOND pool, aa_app_user
(non-BYPASSRLS, real RLS applies), used ONLY by routes that explicitly opt in via
acquire_scoped_conn() below, and only when that route's OWN flag is on.

Rollback (per route, independent of every other route on this pool): `redis-cli DEL
<that route's flag key>` (or SET ... false) reverts it to the admin pool immediately -- no
deploy needed, and does not affect any other route already on the tenant pool.

GUC safety: app.tenant_id is set via set_config(..., is_local=true) INSIDE an explicit
transaction (SET LOCAL semantics) -- scoped to that one transaction so it cannot leak onto the
next request that reuses this same physical connection from the pool. Every query that needs
tenant scoping MUST run inside the same `async with conn.transaction():` block
acquire_scoped_conn() opens -- see its docstring.
