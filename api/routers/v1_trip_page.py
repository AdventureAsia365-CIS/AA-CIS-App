"""AA-482 — [BUILD] Landing page engine (ADR-2026-030, D5: AA HOSTS the white-label tour page).

STEP0 (this task, 04/09/2026) confirmed live:
  - acp_deliver.tenant_tour_pages EXISTS (migration 078) and has 87 rows -- NOT the "0 rows"
    the issue's own description (citing AA-478, 06/08) expected. But every one of those 87
    rows points to the SAME placeholder URL (https://aa-cis.lumiguides.it.com/, the admin
    frontend's own root), all with the identical bulk-insert published_at timestamp -- a
    one-time manual/script seed, not a real per-tour page. 0 real landing pages exist today.
  - Confirmed (grep, re-verified against current code): still 0 real code callers write to
    this table -- AA-478's "0 writers" finding still holds, only the "0 rows" half was stale.
  - T10's gate F6 (services/acp_produce/gates.py, services/acp_produce/pipeline.py) already
    reads `url_alive` from this exact table for real (not mocked) -- fail-closed when no row
    exists. So a real row here has real, immediate downstream effect for any N7-class caller.

This module is the FIRST real slice: a public (no-auth) page-data endpoint the new
frontend/app/trip/[tourId]/page.tsx route renders, plus the write path that was missing
entirely -- an admin-triggered publish endpoint that computes a REAL url (this route's own
URL, not a placeholder) and a lightweight recheck endpoint for the D5 liveness-check ask.

Architecture decisions made here (real, not deferred -- see docs/implementation-notes/AA-482.md
for the full reasoning, this was a genuinely open design question per the issue's own STEP0
list, AskUserQuestion was unavailable in this session so a considered default was picked and
flagged rather than blocking indefinitely):
  - Hosting: a Next.js route in the EXISTING AA-CIS-App frontend (Vercel, already live, atomic
    deploy + instant rollback per this repo's own CLAUDE.md), NOT new S3+CloudFront infra --
    reuses the existing deploy pipeline, no new domain/cert/Terraform needed for a v1.
  - Domain: existing aa-cis.lumiguides.it.com, path-based (/trip/{tour_id}) -- no new domain
    provisioning for a v1.
  - Content source: gold_aa_internal.published_tours' aa_* fields directly (aa_name/
    aa_subtitle/aa_summary/aa_itineraries/aa_highlights/seo_title/seo_meta) -- exactly the
    field set ADR-2026-030's own v_trip_registry view already selects for this purpose. NOT
    T9's landing_page-channel AIDA copy (content_piece) -- that's generated per weekly slot/
    campaign, not 1:1 with a canonical tour, and reusing it would need new "pick the canonical
    piece" logic with no clear v1 benefit.
  - Scope: this v1 serves aa_internal's admin-canonical published tours (the shared catalog) --
    matches v_trip_registry's own real, current JOIN shape exactly. Real per-TENANT rewritten
    versions (gold_aa_internal.tenant_tour_versions) are NOT wired into this page yet -- a
    separate, real follow-up (v_trip_registry's own ttp JOIN is only ON tour_id, not
    tenant_id+tour_id, so it can't already disambiguate multiple tenants' pages for the same
    tour_id today either -- a pre-existing gap in the view itself, not introduced or fixed
    here, flagged in the implementation notes).
