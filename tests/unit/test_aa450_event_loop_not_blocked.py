"""
tests/unit/test_aa450_event_loop_not_blocked.py — AA-450: the T9+T10-inline write/check loop must
NOT block the shared ECS-task event loop, built in from the start (not patched in after an
incident the way N7's AA-416 fix was — see docs/claude_audit/
AA-450-01-t9-t10-retry-loop-investigation.md).

Every blocking LLM call inside services/acp_content_writing/service.py::run_write_background()
(the write call, and quality_gates.py's 2 judge calls) is wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` from
this module's first version. AA-466 split the old single write_and_check() into a fast
pre-flight (start_write()) and this background loop (run_write_background()) — this test now
targets the background loop directly (that's the only part with any real blocking-risk LLM
call; start_write() is DB-only, never at risk of blocking the loop for any meaningful time).
Reproduces AA-416's own test shape exactly (a slow synchronous call standing in for a real
invoke_claude()/invoke_judge() call, run concurrently with a cheap health-check coroutine on the
same event loop) against the REAL run_write_background() call path, not just a synthetic
stand-in for run_gates() the way AA-416's test used.
