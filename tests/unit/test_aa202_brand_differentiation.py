"""AA-202 [AA-193·F1-followup]: brand differentiation profile injection.

The AA-198 resolver only selected 6 legacy brand columns, so the differentiating columns
(core_idea, customer_segment, customer_mindset, voice_examples, good_examples) never reached
generation → all brands read alike. `_build_brand_diff_block` assembles a structured profile +
contrast rule into the system prompt. Pure string assembly — no DB/LLM/network.
