// Now every former tab is its own route (see the sibling directories) — this file is
// just the redirect for anyone landing on the bare /portal URL (old bookmarks, the
// tenant-login page's `router.push("/portal")`, etc). Dashboard was the default tab
// before (`useState<ExtTab>("dashboard")` in the old page.tsx), kept as the default here.
