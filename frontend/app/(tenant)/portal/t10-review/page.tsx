// The screen that sits between T10's automatic quality gate and T11 publish. Route slug
// confirmed with Nghiệp (AA-501 STEP0 §6): "t10" is the one number in the existing
// t0/t1/t4/t6/t7/t8/t11 sequence with no page of its own (T9/T10 were folded into t8-angle-gate's
// wizard by AA-450) — this reads naturally as "the review of what T10 decided" and slots exactly
// where it belongs: between t8-angle-gate ("Write Content") and t11-publish ("Publish").

    // its own, so a page either sets one or fills the available flex space).

    // at the identical position and visually collide. ReviewList's own StickyBar (the one that
    // actually matters for "which channel am I filtered to" while scrolling a long list) covers
    // the real complaint; the breadcrumb above already shows the page name while scrolled.
